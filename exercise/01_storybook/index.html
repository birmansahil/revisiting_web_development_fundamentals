    <h1>The Paper Bag Princess</h1>
    <address>by Robert Munsch</address>

    <p>
      Elizabeth was a beautiful Princess. She lived in a castle and had
      expensive Princess clothes. She was going to marry a prince called Ronald.
      Unfortunately, a dragon smashed her castle, burned all her clothes with
      his fiery breath and carried off Prince Ronald.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elizabeth decided to chase the dragon and get Ronald back. She looked
      everywhere for something to wear, but the only thing she could find that
      was not burned was a paper bag. So she put on the paper bag and followed
      the dragon. He was easy to follow because he left a train of burnt forests
      and horse's bones.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, Elizabeth came to a cave with a large door that had a huge
      knocker on it. She took hold of the knocker and banged on the door. The
      dragon stuck his nose out of the door and said,
      <q>
        Well a princess! I love to eat Princesses, but I have already eaten a
        whole castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.
      </q>
    </p>

    <p>
      He slammed the door so fast that Elizabeth almost got her nose caught.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elizabeth grabbed the knocker and banged on the door again. The dragon
      stuck his nose out of the door and said,
      <q>
        Go away. I love to eat Princesses, but I have already eaten a whole
        castle today. I am a very busy dragon. Come back tomorrow.
      </q>
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>Wait</q> shouted Elizabeth.
      <q>
        Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole
        world?
      </q>
      <q>Yes</q> said the dragon
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>Is it true</q> said Elizabeth,
      <q>that you can burn up ten forests with your fiery breath?</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>Oh yes</q> said the dragon, and he took a huge, deep breath and
      breathed out so much fire that he burned up fifty forests.
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>Fantastic</q> said Elizabeth, and the dragon took another huge breath
      and breathed out so much fire that he burned up one hundred forests.
      <q>Magnificent</q> said Elizabeth, and the dragon took another huge
      breath, but this time nothing came out. The dragon didn't even have enough
      fire left to cook a meatball!
    </p>

    <p>
      Elizabeth said,
      <q>
        Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten
        seconds?
      </q>
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>Why, yes</q> said the dragon, and jumped up and flew all the way around
      the world in just ten seconds. He was very tired when he got back, but
      Elizabeth shouted <q>Fantastic, do it again.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      So the dragon jumped up and flew around the whole world in just twenty
      seconds. When he got back he was too tired to talk, and he lay down and
      went straight to sleep. Elizabeth whispered, very softly,
      <q>hey dragon.</q> The dragon didn't move at all. She lifted up the
      dragon's ear and put her head right inside. She shouted as loud as she
      could <q>HEY, DRAGON!</q>
    </p>

    <p>The dragon was so tired he didn't even move.</p>

    <p>
      Elizabeth walked right over the dragon and opened the door to the cave.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was Prince Ronald. He looked at her and said,
      <q>
        Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all
        tangled, and you are wearing a dirty old paper bag. Come back when you
        are dressed like a real princess.
      </q>
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>Ronald</q> said Elizabeth.
      <q>
        Your clothes are really pretty and your hair is very neat. You look like
        a real Prince, but you are a bum.
      </q>
      They didn't get married after all.
